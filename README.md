# Self-Reflection
I already built one in Python some months ago so I know I could do it but I wasn't feeling prepare to create the design until I remembered a minigame from Club Penguim, a flash based game, that had the same logic but using elements so I made my own version of it :D. 

# What to Improve
I'm waiting the course to teach about the semantic HTML but I know I will need to learn it cause my code is small and is already using a lot of divs making it dirty, I also need to learn how to use less global variables on my code and create more animations like one for clicking the button, more details for the player to see what's going on cause it's just a counter that goes up until 5 and a better style to it but at the same time having less things on screen made it responsible by himself.

# Other bugs
In mobile the hover effect doesn't work maybe cause the touch is a cursor when you touch an element it became with the effect until you click on another button.
